This project explores a dataset containing demographic indicators for 201 countries in the year 2020. The dataset covers key metrics such as population, population density, net migration, fertility rate, and more. Using Tableau, a series of data visualizations were created, including a population density map, which offers insights into population concentration, and comparisons of countries based on net population change, revealing trends and potential future shifts in global demographics. These visualizations are valuable for organizations like the World Health Organization, world leaders, and researchers, aiding in decision-making and sustainable development strategies. The project's findings are summarized, offering valuable insights into population dynamics and trends.
